Bootstrap WordPress Theme

This is a stripped down WordPress theme that distributes a Bootstrap application. 
It was built for a start up in New York City.
The purpose of the application is a bit of a tutorial in using the least amount of services
which will make it easier to see how well Bootstrap works within WordPress.

I plan to do the same thing introducing AngularJS. I am not yet considering this a stater theme though.
More work has to be done, but I like the idea of beginning with the barest distribution of Bootstrap and AngularJS.
That will make adding functionality much more modular.

Most "starter" themes for child development have way to much overhead. They are trying to please everybody
thereby loading it up with everything but the kitchen sink. One is expected to reverse engineer the project
by stripping out services. I felt it would be more informative and intuitive to begin by establishing 
a baseline: the bare minimum that makes a WordPress theme using HTML, CSS and JavaScript frameworks
and then deciding what is going to be processed on the client side, ajax, etc.
and what is left to the PHP server.

Kinda cool.
